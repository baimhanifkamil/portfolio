      <h2>Background</h2>
      <div class="content-full inline-block">
        <p>Supahands' Data Miner is an application used by two users, internal Project Managers and remote workers (SupaAgents). The team moves very quickly to solve problems related to operations scalability and efficiency.</p>
        <p><strong>General Problem:</strong> Our operations are getting bigger and the number of micro-tasks are increasing rapidly. Project managers simply do not have the time to QC every tasks completed by SupaAgents anymore.
          As the number of tasks increases, datelines are becoming harder to meet. What can we do to assist both Project Managers and SupaAgents to work faster and more efficiently thus increasing company's project capacity and revenue? </p>
        <p><strong>Current Team:</strong>
          <li>Me (UI/UX + Minor Dev)</li>
          <li>Isaac (Product Manager)</li>
          <li>Yeong (Dev)</li>
          <li>Chinmay (Dev)</li>
        </p>
        <p><strong>Tools:</strong> Sketch App, Marvel App, Adobe Illustrator</p>
        <p><strong>UX Scope:</strong>The first version was just an experiment to move away from Google Sheets, it was not built for best user experience as there were not enough resources.
          However, it does not take long for us to realize that this product have a massive impact to the business. My mission was to revisit the product to make sure that it provides the best
          user experience for Project Managers and SupaAgents to work efficiently at scale.</p>
      </div>
      <br><br><br><br><br>

      <h2>Process</h2>
      <div class="content-full inline-block">
        <p><strong>1. Analysis</strong><br>
          Since I was not a part of the initial team who work on this product, my knowledge regarding the full functionality of the system was quite limited. I've only worked on ad-hoc features which does not
          necessarily require me to know every functionality.
          <br><br>
          So the first thing I did was to map out all current user actions on Data Miner. This will also help me to evaluate the structure of the product.
          Do we currently have the best user flow structure? Did all the user actions grouped properly since most them were built on an ad-hoc basis?
          <br><br>

          <p class="caption"><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Example of user actions on Data Miner</p>
          <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
          <img src="img/dataminer/Data miner user flow diagram.png" class="center" style="width:50%">
          <p class="caption"><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Current Project Manager's main user flow</p>
          <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
          <p>
            As you would imagine, the list goes on and on and on...
            <br><br>
            The next thing that I did was to conduct user testings with both users. I've prepared a set of questions for both users before conducting the interview.
            By preparing these questions, I can gather a more structured feedback, answers within the same context and it'll also work as meeting agenda for a more productive user interview sessions.

          <br><br>
          <p>It is important to note that I have always been working closely with the SupaAgents support team so I'm already aware about the common UX complaints by SupaAgents.
            <br><br>
            There is also a process gap here, since we didn't have enough resources, I opted out to send questionnaires through email to SupaAgents. This is not
            the best way to gather user feedback. I would prefer doing 1-to-1 user interview sessions.
          </p>
          </p>
        </p>


        <p><strong>2. Design</strong><br>
          I ran through all the user testing results and summarized it. Here are the some of the highlights;
          <br><br>
          <div class="text-tip">

                <li>Yes data miner meets their goals and expectations.</li>
                <li>Need to make it easy to understand/use</li>
                <li>Main actions are QC-ing Agents Work, Export Data, Import Data, Create/edit fields</li>
                <li>Label fonts are too small and not readable</li>
                <li>Show instruction is blocking user activity</li>
                <li>Need to show agent name while QC-ing</li>
                <li>Add bulk edit feature</li>
                <li>Creating field is frustrating</li>
                <li>Add Live view when creating fields</li>
                <li>Show summary of QC results</li>
                <li>Stop SA access when they are removed from projects</li>

          </div>
          <br><br>
          <div class="text-tip">
            <p>
              <strong>Feedbacks from SupaAgents</strong>
              <ol>
                <li>Data miner meets their goals and expectations, it is way better than using Google Sheets</li>
                <li>It has a very simple user interface</li>
                <li>Label fonts are too small and not readable</li>
                <li>Opening and closing instructions are frustrating</li>
                <li>32.3% said that it is hard to view embedded image or website</li>
                <li>35% said there are insufficient error messages</li>
                <li>Input boxes takes too much space</li>
                <li>Need to show how many tasks have been completed in real-time</li>
                <li>80% of users have never used similar product</li>
                <li>60% ranked Data miner higher than other products</li>
              </ol>
            </p>
          </div>
          <br><br>

          <p>
            Based on these feedbacks, I mocked-up a lo-fi wireframes. The reason why I choose lo-fi wireframe is because I don't want
            the users to be distracted by the colors and aesthetics of the design. I would like them to focus on adressing the core UX problem first.
          </p>
          <br><br>

          <p>
            As you can see, I came up with various versions for each pages. This is a very time-consuming process because Data Miner
            is a very complex system. However, it is extremely important since I have a lot of theories and
            I would like it to be validated through user testings. Most of the time, the first idea that came to my mind isn't necessarily
            the optimum solution.
            <br><br>
            Since I am using User-centered Design (UCD) approach, I broke down my design tasks by pages and every time I finished designing for each pages,
            I will conduct 1-to-1 user testings. I will iterate my design if necessary and I will come back to the users to see if their problems were solved.

        <p>Introducing Supahands Workplace, a platform that serves as a digital project management tool for our operations workforce (project managers and SupaAgents). It is equipped with automation features that improve routing of work and task
          efficiency.</p>
        <p><strong>1. Join Projects Instantly</strong><br> Instead of sending back-and-forth requests for project delegation, SupaAgents can view all available projects on Workplace, along with all the necessary information they need before
          starting.</p>
        <p><strong>2. Work Execution and Submission on the Platform</strong><br> With Supahands Workplace, we’ve created a working platform for our operations workforce, that allows all work to be executed and submitted in real-time. This caters for
          increased
          accuracy and automatic deduplication of data point, while also reducing project execution time.</p>
        <p><strong>3. Better Security </strong><br> To answer our client’s security concern on data leakages, we adopted the idea of data slicing (a method to segment a large amount of data into smaller segments) on Supahands Workplace. Hence,
          SupaAgents
          who work on a project are only granted access to their own data output, thus preventing any chances of data leaking.</p>
        <p><strong>4. Track working progress</strong><br> This feature was built for SupaAgents who prefer working on multiple projects at the same time. Supahands Workplace contains a record of all current and historical projects. This allows them
          to keep
          track of all their projects, and manage their time better.</p>
        <p><strong>5. Project and Personal Rating</strong><br> As an initiative to promote quality work, each SupaAgent has a rating score that’s based on the average rating of all completed tasks. This also allows our platform engine and Project
          Managers
          to better select SupaAgents when it comes to a challenging task.</p>
        <p><strong>The Future of Supahands Workplace</strong><br> In the near future, we aim to incorporate more automation and security features on the platform. Ultimately, we envision Supahands Workplace as our primary product platform; a
          platform that
          will seamlessly connect our clients to the thousands of curated and managed SupaAgents across Southeast Asia, providing them with the best of on-demand, crowdsourcing solutions:</p>
